# ToonyPolis
 Toon shader optimised for mobile devices with Unity universal render pipeline. I am using it for various mobile projects that has cartoonish look with not much details.  
 Supports Unity 2020.3LTS version and based on Unlit shader graph, supports SRP batching. 
# Warning 
 You need to enable subtractive in lightmapping in order to achieve the best results with baked and realtime shadows. 
 # TODO: 
 - Add specular maps. 
 - Fix the shadows jaggies after lightmapping static toon unlit objects (you can fix the issue by tuning the lightmap settings), needs more test on different shapes.
 - Add additional lights for more lighting choices.
